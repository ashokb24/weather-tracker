Weather-Tracker Microservice


## Overview
This repo contains a micro-service which interacts with Accuweather to get the current weather condition for a given city and a postcode. To get the data from Accuweather, I have used Accuweather APIs which are exposed by Accuweather.

## Technology Used
Java 8
Spring
SpringBoot

## Few Pointers
- API reference for Accuweather can be found in the URL https://developer.accuweather.com/apis
- One can understand the Accuweather API flow using the url https://developer.accuweather.com/api-flow-diagram
- I would advise you to go through the API documentation first, understand what Accuweather provides that suits your need.
- For my sample application, I wanted to understand on how can I get the current weather condition of a particular city or for a particular postcode. Hence, I have experimented CurrentConditionAPI.
